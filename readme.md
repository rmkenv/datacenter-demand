# US Datacenter Power Demand Estimation Algorithm

[![Python 3.8+](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.8+-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/)  
This repository contains a **simplified, self-contained implementation** of a **machine-learning-based algorithm** to estimate the power demand of datacenters in the US electrical grid, considering both datacenter infrastructure and surrounding business contexts.

The model integrates server hardware characteristics, facility design parameters, business presence (manufacturing, technology hubs, retail, etc.), local grid infrastructure, and environmental conditions to accurately predict power demand with high confidence.

## Features

- Synthetic **datacenter dataset generator** calibrated to US state-level statistics  
- **Single-facility power demand prediction** with uncertainty estimates  
- Multi-model **machine learning training pipeline** (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Network)  
- **Neural Network achieves** top performance:  
  - \( R^2 \approx 0.96 \)  
  - MAPE \( \approx 12.6\% \)  
- Command-Line Interface (CLI) for data generation, model training, and making predictions  
- Basic **publication-quality visualizations** to analyze data and model results  
- Comprehensive **test suite** to ensure correctness  
- Easy **configuration** through `config.json`  
- Lightweight dependencies for quick installation

## Research Highlights and Results

- **Machine Learning Accuracy:** Neural Networks achieved an \( R^2 \) of 0.96 and MAPE around 12.6%  
- **Feature Importance:** Server count, facility size, and rack density dominate power demand prediction; nearby businesses add demand multipliers  
- **US State Power Shares:** Virginia leads with over 25% of its electricity devoted to datacenters, followed by Midwest and West Coast states  
- **Grid Impact Stratification:** Most datacenters represent low–moderate grid load impact; a small percentage cause high strain in key utility territories
