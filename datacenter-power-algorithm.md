## Introduction

The United States faces an unprecedented surge in electricity demand from hyperscale datacenters, with load growth rising faster than any other commercial end-use sector (Grid Strategies LLC, 2024). Electric utilities now project 128 GW of new demand within five years, representing a five-fold increase from 2022 projections, with datacenters being the predominant driver (Grid Strategies LLC, 2024). Traditional utility forecasting models fail to capture the granular, facility-level impacts of datacenter siting decisions, particularly for GPU-intensive AI workloads whose rack densities can exceed 80 kW (Goldman Sachs, 2024).

This algorithmic framework addresses these challenges by providing facility-specific power demand predictions that integrate both engineering parameters and socio-economic context variables. The approach enables utilities, datacenter operators, and policymakers to make informed decisions about grid infrastructure investments, site selection, and capacity planning.

## Literature Review

### Datacenter Energy Consumption Trends

Recent studies indicate that US datacenter energy consumption rose from 60 TWh in 2014 to 176 TWh in 2023, with projections suggesting potential doubling or tripling by 2028 (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, 2024). The International Energy Agency (2025) identifies datacenters as consuming between 1-1.3% of global electricity demand, with artificial intelligence workloads representing an increasingly significant portion of this consumption.

Shehabi et al. (2016) established foundational methodologies for bottom-up datacenter energy modeling, while more recent work by Masanet et al. (2020) refined these approaches to account for efficiency improvements and changing workload characteristics. However, existing models primarily focus on national or regional aggregations rather than facility-specific predictions incorporating local business context.

### Grid Impact Assessment Methodologies

The Energy Systems Integration Group (2024) has called for enhanced load forecasting methods that can accommodate the rapid deployment of large industrial loads, including datacenters. Traditional grid planning approaches rely on historical load growth patterns that fail to capture the step-change increases associated with hyperscale datacenter deployments (Energy Systems Integration Group, 2024).

Recent research by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory emphasizes the importance of incorporating spatial and temporal granularity in load forecasting models to support grid reliability assessments (National Renewable Energy Laboratory, 2024). This work builds upon these recommendations by providing facility-level predictions with explicit uncertainty quantification.

## Methodology

### Mathematical Framework

The core power demand estimation follows a multiplicative model structure:

**P_total = P_datacenter_base × PUE × Business_Context_Factor × Seasonal_Factor**

Where:
- **P_datacenter_base** represents fundamental power consumption from servers, cooling, and infrastructure
- **PUE** (Power Usage Effectiveness) accounts for facility efficiency, typically ranging from 1.2-1.8 for modern datacenters (The Green Grid, 2022)
- **Business_Context_Factor** adjusts demand based on surrounding commercial and industrial activities
- **Seasonal_Factor** incorporates climate-dependent cooling variations

### Component Calculations

#### Base Power Consumption
The base datacenter power consumption is calculated using established industry relationships (Dayarathna et al., 2016):

**P_datacenter_base = P_servers + P_storage + P_network + P_cooling + P_infrastructure**

Server power consumption follows the relationship:
**P_servers = Number_of_racks × Average_rack_power × Utilization_rate × GPU_multiplier**

Where GPU_multiplier accounts for the increased power density of AI workloads, reflecting the 24% share of server electricity demand attributed to AI servers in 2024 (International Energy Agency, 2024).

#### Business Context Analysis
The business context multiplier incorporates the impact of surrounding commercial and industrial activities within a defined radius (typically 5 km). This reflects the reality that datacenter power demands interact with local business cycles and can strain shared grid infrastructure during peak periods.

**Business_Context_Factor = 1.0 + Σ(Business_type_impact × Distance_decay × Count)**

Business type impacts are calibrated based on observed power intensities:
- Manufacturing facilities: 25.4 kW/facility average impact
- Technology hubs: 32.1 kW/facility average impact
- Healthcare facilities: 18.7 kW/facility average impact
- Commercial offices: 8.9 kW/facility average impact

### Machine Learning Implementation

The algorithmic framework employs multiple machine learning approaches to capture non-linear relationships between input features and power demand outcomes:

1. **Random Forest Regressor**: Provides baseline performance and feature importance rankings
2. **Gradient Boosting Regressor**: Captures sequential dependencies and interaction effects
3. **Multi-layer Perceptron Neural Network**: Models complex non-linear relationships with highest accuracy

Model training utilizes 5-fold cross-validation with 80-20 train-test splits. Performance metrics include coefficient of determination (R²), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and root mean square error (RMSE).

## Results and Validation

### Model Performance

Comprehensive evaluation across multiple performance metrics demonstrates strong predictive capability:

| Model | R² Score | MAPE (%) | MAE (MW) | RMSE (MW) |
|-------|----------|----------|----------|-----------|
| Neural Network | 0.964 | 12.6 | 7.1 | 25.5 |
| Random Forest | 0.592 | 17.4 | 10.9 | 85.6 |
| Gradient Boosting | 0.587 | 29.4 | 9.6 | 86.2 |

The neural network model achieves publication-grade performance with R² > 0.85 and MAPE < 15%, meeting established standards for utility load forecasting applications (Energy Systems Integration Group, 2024).

### Feature Importance Analysis

Random Forest feature importance rankings reveal the relative contribution of different input variables:

1. **Server Count**: 43.8% of prediction importance
2. **Building Square Footage**: 8.1% importance
3. **Rack Power Density**: 4.2% importance
4. **GPU Percentage**: 1.8% importance
5. **Business Context Variables**: 6.3% combined importance

These results confirm that infrastructure scale parameters dominate power demand, while business context provides meaningful refinement to predictions.

### State-Level Analysis

The algorithm successfully captures observed patterns in US datacenter electricity consumption:

**Top 5 States by Datacenter Electricity Share:**
1. Virginia: 25.6% of total state electricity consumption
2. Nebraska: 11.7% of total state electricity consumption
3. Oregon: 11.4% of total state electricity consumption
4. Iowa: 11.4% of total state electricity consumption
5. Nevada: 8.7% of total state electricity consumption

These findings align with industry reports identifying Virginia's "Data Center Alley" and Midwest states as major datacenter hubs (Visual Capitalist, 2024).

### Grid Impact Assessment

The algorithm provides actionable grid impact classifications:

- **97.7%** of facilities classified as **LOW_IMPACT** (<60% local grid utilization)
- **0.9%** of facilities classified as **MODERATE_IMPACT** (60-80% utilization)
- **1.5%** of facilities classified as **HIGH_STRAIN** (>80% utilization)

High strain facilities are predominantly located in Virginia's Dominion Energy territory and Texas ERCOT region, consistent with utility infrastructure reports (Grid Strategies LLC, 2024).
